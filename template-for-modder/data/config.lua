-- If you plan on only replacing the placeholder sounds, you can do it by heading to your folder at "audio/waves/va" and placing your own sound files with the same name (don't forget the _1, _2, _3, etc. at the end of the file name, if they are part of a list of sounds), 
-- they will get replaced automatically when the player load your mod AFTER the library


-- If you wish for a sound event to play from a list of sounds, you can update the number that way:
--[[
vas:addSound(hull_alert_75, 2)
]]
-- hull_alert_75 will now play a random sound from a list of 2 sounds

-- you can also override the default cooldown between each sound in the queue for this specific sound event:
--[[
vas:addSound(hull_alert_75, 2, 8)
]]
-- hull_alert_75 will now play a random sound from a list of 2 sounds, and the following sound in the list will have to wait 8 seconds before playing


-- You can also use the same method to add your own sound event:
--[[
vas:addSound(my_custom_event, 3)
]]

-- You can also remove a sound event from the list (if you do not like it, or have nothing to replace it with):
--[[
vas:removeSound(my_custom_event)
]]


-- You will have to setup your own callback to trigger the sound events, for example:
--[[
local function activate_power(power, ship)
    vas:playSound("my_custom_event")
end

script.on_internal_event(Defines.InternalEvents.ACTIVATE_POWER, activate_power)
]]
-- This will trigger the sound event "my_custom_event" when a crew power is activated
-- You will also need to add the sounds event to the list of sounds in the file sounds.xml.append
